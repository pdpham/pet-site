# pet-site

My mentee wanted to learn html, css and javascript. She set out to build a website to help people find animal shelters from which to adopt their new life long furry friend. She created a website with a home page, life of fred game, and resources page.

Her project consists of the following files:
   index.html - landing page of her website
   petsite.css - CSS stlye for all pages
   game.html - Game for the journey of her dog Fred from shelter to home, in Scratch
   firstgame.css - CSS style for firstgame.html
   resources.html - Resources and links to learn more about pets and shelters in the Bay Area

The website is hosted on her github account:
    https://fredlover8.github.io/pet-site/

Other than the above files, nothing else is needed to run these games.
